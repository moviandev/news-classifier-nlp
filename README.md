# News Classifier
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying news articles as real or fake based on their textual content.

## How to run
- Set the environment to python3;
- In `main.ipynb` is all the models of the project;
- If needed change in the code block `Load dataset` the path in the variable `testing_path` for the testing dataset needed, keep in mind, the dataset should follow the same structure that `testing_data_lowercase_nolabels.csv` dataset;
- Run each model and then it'll generate a final file `final_predictions_[model_name].csv`

## Thank you note
We of the group 2 hope you enjoy our project.
